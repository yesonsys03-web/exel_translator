# AI_DEV_SYSTEM_SINGLE_FILE.md

## Purpose

This file defines the default AI development rules for this project.

Any AI coding tool working on this repository should follow these rules before making changes.

Examples:
- OpenCode
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- GPT-based coding workflows
- agent-based coding systems

The goal is simple:

**Use AI for speed, but preserve project structure, safety, and maintainability.**

---

## Core Rule

**Apply the smallest safe patch possible.**

Do not rewrite entire files unless the user explicitly asks for a rewrite.

---

## 1. Patch-First Editing Rules

- patch only
- prefer small changes over broad rewrites
- edit only the file that is actually relevant
- do not modify unrelated modules
- do not perform drive-by cleanup unless explicitly requested
- do not rename files unless required for the requested task
- do not move files unless required for the requested task
- do not refactor broadly unless the task explicitly asks for refactoring

### Required behavior
- preserve working code whenever possible
- keep diffs reviewable
- keep changes easy to explain
- prefer one focused change over many scattered changes

---

## 2. Entry File Protection Rules

Entry files must stay small and focused.

Examples:
- `main.py`
- `index.js`
- `app.js`
- `main.ts`
- `Program.cs`

### Rules
- do not dump business logic into entry files
- keep entry files focused on bootstrapping / startup wiring
- move processing logic into dedicated modules
- move UI rendering logic out if the entry file is growing too large
- if an entry file is already too large, do not make it larger unless absolutely necessary

### Preferred pattern
- entry file → startup only
- service / worker / pipeline files → real logic
- UI file → UI only
- config file → configuration only

---

## 3. Anchor Rules

Anchors define safe edit zones.

Example:

```python
# === ANCHOR: PIPELINE_WORKER_START ===
# code here
# === ANCHOR: PIPELINE_WORKER_END ===
```

### Rules
- respect anchor boundaries
- prefer editing inside anchors
- if the requested change clearly belongs to an anchor, stay inside that anchor
- do not rewrite the whole file if an anchor exists for the target area
- if a large file has no anchors, prefer adding anchors before repeated AI edits
- do not remove existing anchors unless explicitly requested

### If anchors exist
The AI should treat them as the preferred editing boundaries.

---

## 4. Structure Safety Rules

Avoid the following patterns unless explicitly required:

- giant `main.py`
- giant `pipeline.py`
- giant `ui.py`
- giant `translator.py`
- catch-all files such as:
  - `utils.py`
  - `helpers.py`
  - `misc.py`
  - `all_utils.py`

### Rules
- prefer domain-specific module names
- separate UI code from business logic
- separate pipeline orchestration from worker logic
- separate translation logic from UI state handling
- separate configuration from execution logic
- separate formatting / validation / retry logic when files grow too large

---

## 5. UI and Business Logic Separation

UI files should mainly handle:
- layout
- widgets
- user interaction
- display updates
- progress display
- input validation at the UI boundary

Business logic files should mainly handle:
- processing
- file operations
- translation work
- networking
- retries
- orchestration
- worker execution

### Rules
- do not mix UI rendering and heavy processing logic in one file unless explicitly intended
- if UI files are starting to manage pipeline internals, split logic out
- if business logic starts to depend on UI state directly, introduce a cleaner interface

---

## 6. File Growth Control

When editing existing code:

- prefer small file growth
- avoid turning one file into the project center of gravity
- if a file is already large, consider splitting instead of extending it further
- if many new functions are being added to one module, ask whether a new module boundary is more appropriate

### Soft guidance
- small file: easy to edit safely
- medium file: still manageable
- large file: high AI rewrite risk
- huge file: strong candidate for splitting

---

## 7. Naming Rules

Prefer clear, specific names.

Good examples:
- `backup_worker.py`
- `hash_service.py`
- `translation_pipeline.py`
- `progress_widget.py`
- `retry_policy.py`

Avoid vague names unless there is a strong reason:
- `utils.py`
- `helpers.py`
- `common.py`
- `misc.py`

---

## 8. Change Scope Rules

Before making a code change, the AI should determine:

1. What is the smallest relevant file to edit?
2. Is there an existing anchor for the change?
3. Can this be solved with a patch instead of a rewrite?
4. Does this change affect unrelated modules?
5. Will this make the project structure worse?

If the answer to #4 or #5 is yes, reduce the change scope.

---

## 9. Explanation Rules

After making changes, the AI should be able to explain:

- what changed
- where it changed
- why that file was chosen
- why unrelated files were not modified
- whether risk increased or decreased

Changes should remain easy for a non-programmer to review.

---

## 10. Safety Rules for Non-Programmer Workflows

This project should remain usable by people who do not deeply understand the code.

Therefore:

- prefer predictable structure
- prefer explicit modules over cleverness
- avoid hidden side effects
- avoid broad changes that are hard to verify
- prefer code that can be explained plainly
- preserve working flows whenever possible

---

## 11. Recommended VibeGuard Workflow

Use this loop whenever possible:

```bash
vibeguard doctor --strict
vibeguard anchor
vibeguard patch "your request here"
# apply AI edit
vibeguard explain --write-report
vibeguard guard --strict --write-report
```

### Meaning
- `doctor` → inspect structure
- `anchor` → create safer edit zones
- `patch` → generate structured request
- `explain` → summarize what changed
- `guard` → verify whether it is safe to continue

## 13. Default AI Instruction Template

Use this when sending tasks to an AI tool:

```text
Follow AI_DEV_SYSTEM_SINGLE_FILE.md.

Task:
[describe the requested change]

Target file:
[fill in target file]

Target anchor:
[fill in anchor if available]

Constraints:
- patch only
- do not rewrite unrelated files
- keep entry files small
- respect anchors
- avoid mixing UI and business logic

Goal:
[describe expected result]
```

---

## 14. Final Principle

**Fast AI edits are useful. Safe AI edits are better.**

If there is a conflict between speed and structure, prefer structure.
